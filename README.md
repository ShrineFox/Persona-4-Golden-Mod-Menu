## Usage (PC)
1. Download and unzip [Aemulus Package Manager](https://gamebanana.com/tools/6878) and add the [latest compiled Release](https://github.com/ShrineFox/Persona-4-Golden-Mod-Menu/releases) to the "Packages" folder.
2. Point Aemulus to your P4G game directory's "mods" folder and build the Mod Menu in combination with any other mods you may want to install.
3. Use the [latest p4gpc.modloader](https://amicitia.github.io/post/p4g-pc-modloader) with [Reloaded II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II/releases) to launch P4G with mods.
## Compiling the scripts yourself
You don't have to follow this section if you're merely installing the mod. This is for developers who want to make changes to the mod.  
1. Download the latest build of TGE's [AtlusScriptCompiler](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/TGEnigma/atlusscripttoolchain/build/artifacts) ([source](https://github.com/TGEnigma/AtlusScriptToolchain)), which is used to compile the **.flow** and **.msg** scripts in this repository and recompile them into **.bf** format.
2. Download this [P4G Library](https://github.com/Tupelov/Persona-Library) that includes some function names used in this menu. Extract it and overwrite the contents of the **AtlusScriptTools\Libraries folder**.
3. Also download [TGE's PAKTools](https://github.com/TGEnigma/AtlusFileSystemLibrary/releases) which is used to repack BIN/PAK files.
4. Edit the build.bat file with the paths to your AtlusScriptCompiler and PAKTool exe files. Name your edited copy build_local.bat.
5. Place the **init_free.bin file from your copy of the game** in the build/input folder (see below).
6. Run build_local.bat.

When you run the bat, the **field.bf** script will be recompiled into a new BF file including the Mod Menu (with the latest changes) and packed into a new init_free.bin.
- **field.bf** can be found in **init_free.bin** (extracted from data_e.cpk with [preappfile](https://amicitia.github.io/post/preappfile) or from data00004.pac with [NR2_unpacker](https://modworkshop.net/mod/17641).)
